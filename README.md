# NoelTools

A toolkit for Alice in Cradle based on BepInEx6.

# Installation

- Download BepInEx Bleeding Edge (BE) builds from [official website](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be). You need to download the file like `BepInEx-Unity.Mono-win-x64-6.0.0-be.xxx+xxxxxxx.zip`.

- Extract the zip file of BepInEx to the root folder of `AliceInCradle`.

- Download NoelTool.zip from the release page and extract it into the folder `BepInEx/plugins`. Or, you can build it by yourself by running `dotnet build` in the folder `NoelTools`, and then copy it from `NoelTools/bin/Debug/net46/` to the plugins folder.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using wine on linux, you should open `winecfg` and in the `Libraries` tab, set `winhttp` to `(native, builtin)`.

- Run the game! (*^▽^*)
